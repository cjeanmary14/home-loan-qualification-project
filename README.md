# Home Loan Qualifiacation Project

## Objective:

The company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real-time) based on customer detail provided while filling out the online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process, they have given a problem identifying the customer segments eligible for loan amounts to target these customers specifically.

## About Project

-I plan to make a machine learning algorithm that would determine if a future applicant about be approved for a home loan based on provided existing data.

-This project is not finished yet, but the goal is to automate the home loan application process by giving the applicant information on whether he/she would qualify using the information that was entered by loan applicants.

-In the meantime, I made a report of the applicants and co-applicants that qualify for home loan from each gender. It also provides information on average monthly income, marital status, existing credit, etc.

## Data Preparing Process:

-I mainly used python in a Jupyter Notebook file to analyze, clean, and transform the data in order to make the visualization report.

-I then used another Jupyter Notebook to make predictions with the cleaned data set.
